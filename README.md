Embed OWL (Outliner with Wiki Linking) in an Android app.

What is this?
-------------

This takes [OWL](https://github.com/interstar/OWL), the Concord-derived Outliner with Wiki Linking, and embeds it in an Android app. using WebView.

The outliner / wiki works just as the in-browser version, but the Android app. now provides the layer to save pages as OPML files to the SD Card of your Android device.

Status
------

It's very, very crude and experimental. In just about works for me, but I've not tested it widely. If you're interested in this approach and want some help getting it working, then get in touch with me. 

Gotchas
--------
Note that I've forked all the OWL / Concord code (things are not in the standard directories. I'll try to put them back soon.)

I'm saving the pages into a directory on your Android device called /sdcard/OWL/ ... make sure you've created it.
